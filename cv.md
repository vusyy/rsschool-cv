# **Hi, I'm Vusal**

I like to learn about programming. And also I like play video games and watch TV series. (I don't know what to add ) 
Lately, I've been trying to improve my web-dev skills, cause I like to study and explore new stuff. The main reason that has motivated me so far is because I want to build my future.
